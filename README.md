# QURScanner

QURScanner is a Qt widget whose main purpose is to demonstrate the receiving of [UR ("Uniform Resources")](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) data embedded in QR codes. It utilizes the QCamera for capturing frames in which the QR codes are detected and decoded using the OpenCV's [wechat_qrcode](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) module. Only the QR codes that contain UR data are processed further. The UR data are decoded using the [bc-ur](https://github.com/PavelNajman/bc-ur) library and their hashes are computed and visualized using the [bc-lifehash](https://github.com/PavelNajman/bc-lifehash) library. The widget supports both single-part and multi-part URs.
